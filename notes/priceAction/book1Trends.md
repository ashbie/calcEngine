# TRADING PRICE ACTION: TRENDS
Alternative way of describing ABC pullBacks/corrections:
- When there is a pullback in a bull leg, the first bar whose high surpases the prior/previous bar's high is a high 1 long entry
- If the pullback continues down for a second leg, then the first bar (in the second leg) that goes above the high of the previous bar's high would be the high 2 entry
- In a sideways ABC pullback, it is common for the C leg to not pass the A leg level
