# TRADING PRICE ACTION: TRENDS
Alternative way of describing ABC pullBacks/corrections:
- When there is a pullback in a bull leg, the first bar whose high surpases the prior/previous bar's high is a high 1 long entry
- If the pullback continues down for a second leg, then the first bar (in the second leg) that goes above the high of the previous bar's high would be the high 2 entry
- In a sideways ABC pullback, it is common for the C leg to not pass the A leg level
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ask ChatGPT to explain this part: "The big legs are unstoppable but the small price action is fine-tuned by some institutional traders who are watching every tick or have programs designed to take trades based on small price movement. For example, some Emini traders will try to scalp-out with a one-point profit, or four ticks... "
- In general, any trade over 100 contracts should be considered institutional in today's Emini market
- Institutions can sometimes buy the high to prevent a potential 5 tick failure (and they think the market will go higher and they will likely buy more as it goes up)
- Four-tick scalps work so often
- In 5 minute bar charts: It is very common in strong trends for a reversal bar to reverse it's appearance in the final few seconds before the bar closes.
- Therefore, when buying countertrend against a strong trend, it is imperative to wait for the signal bar to close before placing my order, and then only enter on a stop at one tick beyond the bar in the direction of your trade (if I'm buying, buy at one tick above the high of the prior bar on a stop).

 <summary> Appearance reversal before candle/bar close </summary>
> What about this part: 
```text
Traders pay close attention to the seconds before key time frames close, especially 3, 5, 15, and 60 minute bars. This is also true on key volumes for volume bar charts. For example, if many traders follow the 10,000 shares per bar chart for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures contract, then when the bar is about to close (it closes on the first trade of any size that results in at least 10,000 shares traded since the start of the bar, so the bar is rarely exactly 10,000 shares), there may be a flurry of activity to influence the final appearance of the bar. One side might want to demonstrate a willingness to make the bar appear more bullish or bearish. In simplest terms, a strong bull trend bar means that the bulls owned the bar. It is very common in strong trends for a reversal bar to totally reverse its appearance in the final few seconds before a 5 minute bar closes.

Great questions — you’re digging into some advanced but really important concepts in price-action and market behavior. Let’s break each one down in simple terms:

---

### 🧠 **1. "Reversal of appearance" — whose appearance is being reversed?**

This refers to the **price bar's appearance on the chart**, not a person or trader. Specifically, the **candle/bar that’s forming** during a time frame (like a 5-minute chart) can **change its shape dramatically in the final seconds before it closes**.

---

### 🟩🟥 **2. What does "reverse the appearance" mean?**

Let’s use candlestick bars to illustrate. A candlestick has:

- **Open**: where price started for that time period  
- **Close**: where price ended for that time period  
- **High/Low**: the extremes reached during that time

Here’s what reversal of appearance might look like:

#### Say it’s a 5-minute candle/bar:
- Price **opened at $100**
- It **rose to $104**
- Now it’s **sitting at $103** right before the 5 minutes ends → Looks like a **strong bullish bar** 📈

BUT in the **final seconds**, a flood of selling happens:
- Price **drops quickly to $99**
- The candle now **closes at $99**

Now it **looks bearish**, maybe even like a bearish reversal candle 📉.

So the **"reversal of appearance"** just means that the **bar was looking one way (bullish or bearish)** but **suddenly changed** in its final moments before closing.

---

### 📊 **3. What will the whole chart look like after this reversal?**

The chart will show that **particular bar as a bearish bar**, not bullish.  
Even if it **looked bullish the entire 5 minutes**, what matters to traders is **how it ends** — just like in sports, **the final score** is what counts.

So if many bars suddenly flip from bullish to bearish near the close:
- The chart might start to **signal a weakening trend**
- Traders might interpret it as **loss of momentum** or a potential **reversal coming**

---

### 💰 **4. What is the '10-Year U.S. Treasury Note Futures contract'?**

This isn’t about the value of the **US Dollar** in 10 years.

It’s about the **interest rates** (or yield) on **10-Year U.S. Treasury Notes**, which are **debt securities** issued by the U.S. government. Here's the breakdown:

- The **U.S. Treasury** borrows money by issuing these notes.
- Investors **lend money** to the government by **buying the notes**.
- The **"10-Year"** part means the government will **pay back the full amount in 10 years**, with **interest along the way**.

#### 🏦 What’s a *futures contract* on it?

A **futures contract** is a **bet/contract to buy or sell** that note **at a specific price on a future date**.

So when people trade the **10-Year Treasury Note Futures**, they are:

- Speculating on **future interest rate movements**
- Trying to profit from changes in **bond prices**, which move **inversely** to interest rates

📈 If interest rates are expected to go **down**, the bond's price **goes up**, and vice versa.

---

So no, they’re not betting on the **USD's value directly** — they’re trading on **expectations about interest rates**, inflation, and monetary policy, all of which affect the broader economy and financial markets.

---

Let me know if you want a visual or simplified diagram of this — it really helps bring all of it together.

Ash: 
Yes, I want a visual diagram.

And concerning the Treasure Note Futures:
How come the price goes up if interest rates are expected to go down, and vice versa.
That doesn't make sense to me coz:
- if the rates are expected to go up; Doesn't that mean that the issuing government will have to pay the one who bought the bond more money?; So won't that make the bond more valuable hence making it's price go up??; And vice versa.

GPT:

Great questions again! Let's tackle both parts — first with a **visual diagram**, and then we’ll **explain the interest rate and bond price relationship** step by step.

## 🔍 PART 1: **Visual of "Bar Reversal Before Close"**

Here's a simple sketch of what happens when the **appearance of a candlestick/bar reverses** in the final seconds:

```
⏰ Minute 1 to 4:58 — Bullish Bar Forming

    Price
    ↑
104 |         
103 |         ████
102 |         ████
101 |         ████
100 | ▓▓▓▓▓▓  ████
    +----------------→ Time

Bar looks bullish! Opened at 100, currently at 103.

⏱️ Final Seconds (4:59 to 5:00) — Sudden Sell-Off

    Price
    ↑
104 |
103 |         ████
102 |         ████
101 |         ████
100 | ▓▓▓▓▓▓  ████
 99 | ████████████ ← Final close
    +----------------→ Time

💥 Now the bar **closes at 99**, below where it opened at 100.

➡️ This **reverses its appearance** from a bullish candle to a **bearish one**, just before the 5-minute bar closes.
```

## 🧮 PART 2: **Why Do Bond Prices Fall When Interest Rates Rise?**

It **does feel backwards at first**, but it makes sense once you understand how bonds work.

---

### 💡 Let's take a simple example:

Let’s say you buy a **10-year Treasury bond** for **$1,000** that pays a **fixed 3% interest rate** per year (called the **coupon rate**).  
That means you earn **$30 per year** for the next 10 years.

---

### 🚨 Now imagine interest rates rise to **5%**

New bonds being issued now pay **$50/year** on the same $1,000 investment.

Your bond still only pays **$30/year**, which now looks **less attractive**.

👉 So if someone wanted to sell that old 3% bond, they’d have to **sell it for less than $1,000** to make it competitive.

🔁 That’s why when **interest rates go up**, **bond prices go down**.

---

### 📉 The Reverse is Also True:

If interest rates **fall** to, say, **2%**, then your 3% bond is suddenly a **great deal**, and people are willing to **pay more than $1,000** to get it.

So:
- 📈 **Rates go down → Prices go up**
- 📉 **Rates go up → Prices go down**

---

### ⚖️ Why This Matters for Treasury Futures:

When traders buy or sell Treasury futures, they’re **speculating** on future interest rate moves:

- If they **expect rates to fall**, they might **go long (buy)** the futures to profit from rising bond prices.
- If they **expect rates to rise**, they might **short (sell)** the futures, since bond prices will drop.
