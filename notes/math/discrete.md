## Learning Plan
1. The Basic Concepts of Dis. Math
2. Applying (aka Implementing) Dis. Math in Computer Science (and Data Science)

## Basic Concepts and Definition
Discrete Mathematics is the study of **countable** *mathematical structures*.
Discrete Mathematics is the study of **distinct** *mathematical structures*.
Discrete Mathematics is the study of **separate** *mathematical structures*.

Examples of objects studied in Dis. Math:
- Logical statements
- Graphs
- Networks
- Bits and Bytes

The above listed things can form intricate patterns which we can exploit for various purposes related to Computer (and Data) Science.

- You need to understand the principles of Discrete mathematics in order to understand the underlying ideas of Computer Algorithms.
- You need to understand the principles of Discrete mathematics in order to understand the underlying ideas of Software Development / Programming Languages.



### Side Quests
#### Continuum Math
Many areas of Mathematics, such as algebra or calculus, focus on `Continuums`. These are mathematical objects that take values over continuous ranges, such as the set of numbers *x* between 0 and 1, or mathematical functions plotted as smooth curves.
These objects come with their own class of mathematical methods, but are mostly distinct from the methods for discrete problems.

#### Number Theory
The study of counting numbers (Numbers that are used to count stuff)

#### Cryptography
The art and science of converting data and information into encoded forms that can be ideally **ONLY** be decoded by authorized entities.

This field makes heavy use of:
- Number theory
- Algorithms on base-n number systems 

#### Graph Theory
- used in Logistics
- airlines use it too

#### Set Theory
A relational database makes use of the concept of set theory in order to group together relevant information.
- Chapter 8: Storage and Feature Extraction of Trees, Graphs, and Networks.

#### Machine Learning
This is the area that seeks to automate statistical and analytical methods so systems can find useful patterns in data, learn, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

#### Analysis of Algorithms
**Algorithm**: *Any set of instructions to accomplish a task*

An effective algorithm must:
1. solve the problem
2. terminate in a useful amount of time (i.e.: not take too much time to terminate)
3. not take up too much space

To ensure the 2nd condition: `terminate in a useful amount of time`, it is often necessary to:
- `count the number of operations` an algorithm must complete in order to terminate

which can be complex, but can be done through `methods of combinatorics`

The 3rd condition requires a similar counting of memory usage.

## Terms
### **Combinatorics**
- **Definition**: A branch of mathematics that studies finite or discrete structures. It deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of elements in sets according to specified rules.
- **Applications**: Widely used in computer science (e.g., algorithms, complexity, cryptography), statistics, and optimization problems.
- **Etymology**: Derived from the **Latin** word *combinare* ("to combine") and the **Greek** suffix *-ics*, meaning "study of."
  
### **Combinatronics**
- **Definition**: Not a recognized mathematical field. It may be a typo or a playful/invented term. Occasionally, it is used informally in some contexts to refer to computational applications of combinatorics, though this usage is rare.
- **Etymology**: Likely a blend or misunderstanding of "combinatorics" and "electronics" or "mechanics."

If you encountered "combinatronics" in a specific context, it might have a niche meaningâ€”feel free to share more details for clarification!
